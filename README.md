# ctfcode
Template for CTF-Challenges. Inspired by others like the ones from [kitctf](https://github.com/kitctf/ctfcode/tree/master/ExploitTemplates) and [saelo](https://github.com/saelo/ctfcode) and some parts from [niklasb](https://github.com/niklasb/ctf-tools/)

This templates builds on pwntools, so you need to install pwntools before
```sh
pip install pwntools
```
For more information, see the [complete pwntools installation instructions here](https://pwntools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html)
